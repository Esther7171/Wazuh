## Change Dashboard logo





```
cd /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/plugins/securityDashboards/target/public
```
You will find `Wazuh` logo.svg. In my case it's like this `30e500f584235c2912f16c790345f966.svg`
SO what u need to do is to get your own svg and do path manuplation, first thing first make a backup of this svg
```
mv 30e500f584235c2912f16c790345f966.svg 30e500f584235c2912f16c790345f966.svg.bak
