## üîç SIEM vs EDR: Key Differences

| Feature                    | **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**         | **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus**          | Aggregation, correlation, and analysis of logs/events        | Real-time monitoring and response on **endpoints**      |
| **Data Sources**           | Logs from various sources: firewalls, servers, AD, apps      | Data from endpoints (PCs, laptops, servers)             |
| **Scope**                  | **Network-wide visibility**                                  | **Endpoint-specific visibility**                        |
| **Detection Capabilities** | Correlation-based, rule-based, and behavior-based detection  | Behavioral analysis and threat detection on endpoints   |
| **Response Capabilities**  | Alerting, automated actions (e.g., ticket creation, scripts) | Isolation, process killing, file quarantine             |
| **Use Case**               | Threat detection, compliance, auditing, threat hunting       | Malware/ransomware containment, deep investigation      |
| **Data Volume**            | High (centralized logs from many devices)                    | Moderate to high (endpoint telemetry)                   |
| **Examples**               | Splunk, Wazuh, IBM QRadar, ArcSight                          | CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender ATP |

## üß† How They Work Together

* **SIEM** gives you a **bird‚Äôs eye view** of the organization. It‚Äôs used to **detect patterns** across multiple systems.
* **EDR** gives you **granular insight** into individual endpoints ‚Äî ideal for **forensic analysis** and **rapid response**.

## ‚úÖ Ideal Use

| Scenario                                      | Use SIEM? | Use EDR? |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Organization-wide threat detection            | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ        |
| Endpoint malware containment                  | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ        |
| Log analysis for compliance/audits (ISO, PCI) | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå        |
| Advanced persistent threat (APT) detection    | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ        |
| Real-time endpoint response                   | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ        |

## üéØ Summary

* **Use SIEM** to collect and correlate logs from everywhere.
* **Use EDR** to dig deep into what‚Äôs happening on individual devices and respond quickly.

In modern SOCs, **SIEM and EDR are complementary**. Many MDR and XDR platforms now combine both capabilities for better efficiency.
