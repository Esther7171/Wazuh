# <div align="center">Virus Total Integration with Wazuh</div>

<br>Wazuh uses the integrator module to connect to external APIs and alerting tools such as VirusTotal.

You need a [VirusTotal API key](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) in this use case to authenticate Wazuh to the VirusTotal API.
Just Create an Account and get your api key

> ### How will it work?
> We'll integrate VirusTotal API with the Wazuh server and create a Python-based executable for agents to detect and remove malware using VirusTotal data.
